This is a simple file in Ada based on the Learning Ada book. It explores simple ideas like reading valuables, functions, and logical operations.
The main file runs several operations. Firstly, it uses the function in the Increment_By file to increment a given number with a given number. Then it runs several simple scripts that use loops, logic, and reading data in and out of the program working with strings and integers. 

The code in these scripts can be found fully explained in the book found at this link: learn.adacore.com.
